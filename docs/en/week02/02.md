## Practicum
Neural Networks are composed of linear and non-linear blocks.  Affine Transformations are linear transformations which perform the operations of translation/shifting, scaling, rotation, reflection, and sheering.  When you see a matrix, you are performing a linear transformation.  With non-linear functions we can now perform squashing/twisting.  No combination of linear transformations can replicate a non-linear function.
