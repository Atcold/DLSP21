## Lecture part A
We provide an introduction to the problem of speech recognition using neural models, emphasizing the CTC loss for training and inference when input and output sequences are of different lengths.


## Lecture part B
We discuss beam search for use during inference, and how that procedure may be modeled at training time using a Graph Transformer Network.


## Practicum
