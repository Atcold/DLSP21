## Diagram.net

Diagrams.net is a great tool to draw neural network diagrams. Next we will introduce a few rules to make our diagrams more consistent with the ones in lecture.

The grayscale background means this is an observation, which means they are data points from a given dataset. You can check the input and labels by going to the directory of the dataset if you want.

We use "Delay" to denote the encoder(e.g., neural network).

In this example, $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$  are observations.

In the half above, we feed the $\vec{x}$ to a given encoder to get a prediction $\vec {\bar{y}}$. This is called forward propagation.

In the half below, we want to get the prediction $\vec {\bar x}$ given observation $\vec{y}$. We keep doing gradient descent to make the network output as close as to $\vec{y}$. This is called amortizing inference.
