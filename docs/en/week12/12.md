## Practicum
We introduced the state transition function and the way to model a physical system with state and control. We discussed how to achieve optimal control by inference using Kelley-Bryson algorithm, which utilizes backprop through time and gradient descent. Finally, we explained the notebook of Optimization_Path_Planner, in which various cost functions are defined and path planning is implemented to guide a tri-cycle to reach the desired position with the specified speed.
