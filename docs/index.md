## Description

This course concerns the latest techniques in deep learning and representation learning, focusing on supervised and unsupervised deep learning, embedding methods, metric learning, convolutional and recurrent nets, with applications to computer vision, natural language understanding, and speech recognition. The prerequisites include: [DS-GA 1001 Intro to Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-curriculum/) or a graduate-level machine learning course.

## Lectures

Most of the lectures are similar to the previous edition, nevertheless, some are brand new.
I will try to make clear the difference.
